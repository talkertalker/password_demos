A demonstration of two string evaluation methods in Javascript.

<b>What I learned from this project:</b>

Planning ahead is key for large projects like this.

In the future, I should use a framework like Angular.js or Bootstrap to help simplify model-viewer changes.

<b>Known bugs:</b>

In the first test, the hidden confirmation input field can still be accessed by pressing "tab."
